					<p class = "paragraph" id = "games-description-body">Below you'll find some arcade games that I made.
						While short and sweet, they demonstrate some core programming & game mechanic principles and were 
						fun to make. Currently, I'm in the process of learning Unity in order to develop my own video games.
						I think ultimately, I'd like to work with my brothers to make a retro JRPG, creating everything from 
						the artwork and music to the story and core game mechanics. In the meantime though, I'll be working 
						on smaller scale platformers and action games to help develop my skills.
