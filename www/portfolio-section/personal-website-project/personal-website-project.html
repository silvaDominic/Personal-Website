							When I had come up with the conceptual framework for this project roughly a year ago, it was
							intended to solely be a photography website. The design was incredibly minimal and was
							to be less about me and why I enjoy photography and more about the images and the exploration
							of the different albums.

							Once development for the website began in February of 2016 and I began fleshing out the front-end,
							 I realized that the website would be better suited as a general portfolio website rather than
							 something more specific. Sticking with the theme of the previous design, my goal was to
							 avoid the common daily blogger design and instead implementing a very minimalistic design that
							 evoked a sense of exploration.

							<h2 class="diagram-title">Initial Design</h2>
							<p class="diagram-description">When I considered how my photographs would be presented in the context
								of a website, my first thought was to make a design that suggested it wasn't one. This meant no standard
								sections like home, about, contact, etc. or visual cues like nav-bars, menu panes, tables, etc. If anything,
								I wanted the user to scratch their head and get a little curious.

								I eventually decided that the albums should feel as though they are places and can be 'entered' like doorways. This is exactly what I ended doing. The doors would appear in a
								blank white 'room' and feel as if they were alive; Birds come and go from a nature album, waitors occasionally pop in and out of a kitchen album,
								water breaks at the shore of a beach album, etc. I have to admit, I was ambitious at first, considering flash animations and even sound effects, but
								I wanted the user to feel as though they were actually entering a space and not just clicking a link.

								Upon entering the album, a user would be presented with a fullscreen gallery with no menus or visible buttons.
								Moving the mouse however, would reveal a slider and back button disguised as a doorway related to the theme of the album. What I liked about this design is that I could keep building
								onto it. Perhaps as I accumulated more pictures related to a particular album, the doors would begin to become a part of a greater setting that could be further interacted with.
								Unfortunately, I didn't have the know how to do all of this and a lot of the flare was stripped from the design.

							<p class="diagram-description">After realizing how ambitious I was with the first design, I decided to take a step back.
								The idea was to keep the minimal design but extend the site's purpose. This was done with large button icons that would lead to other subpages of the site including a "games"
								and "photography" section.

								The "games" section featured a spinning wheel that, when clicked, would randomly select a game and display it in a popout window.
								The "photography" section adopted the initial site design and featured a series of themed doorways that led to different photo albums.
								The middle section would essentially be a more verbose resume, featuring an about-me paragraph, skill-list, a few sentences on interests, and contact info.

							<p class="diagram-description">Eventually, I found that the resume design wasn't really looking or feeling like a modern day site.
								I went to the internet for help, found a few examples of what I liked, and landed on a top-to-bottom node design. It retained the
								minimal aspect I wanted and would remain sleek without requiring too much styling or script.

							<p class="diagram-description">The nodes were to have abbreviated titles (i.e. ‘A’ for About Me), but when hovered over, become highlighted
								and reveal the entire section name. If clicked two larger circles would fade-in to the left and right of the selected node.
								This would include a brief introduction to the section along with a link to a more in depth subpage or contact info. After I had the basic
								layout made, I started to realize that the circular nature of the nodes limited the amount of text and formatting possibilities and I later abandoned
								the concept.

							<p class="diagram-description">I quickly realized that I was losing a lot of space with the window frame design and that I should be treating
								the entire screen as the window frame. I also didn’t like the idea of having a default section already open. It felt like a step was missing or that
								it wasn’t obvious that the buttons were to be clicked. I decided to make the buttons have 2 states: an initial retracted state and
								a final expanded state. This gives the site a nice minimal design like the original Node design and allows the user to ‘enter’
								the site in a way. Once expanded, the buttons can be clicked and the previous content will be faded out and corresponding content
								faded in.

								Originally supposed to be a simple, single paged photography portfolio, the site slowly evolved into a more comprehensive
								portfolio of some of my work and skills. Covering everything from frontend design, backend development, and server setup,
								this proved to be an all encompassing endeavor and one of the hardest projects I've worked on period. After a couple of months of
								non-stop development, I had achieved the minimal design I set out for as well as a place to share my story and work.
