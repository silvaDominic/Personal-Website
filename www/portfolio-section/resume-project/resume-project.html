							A little over a year ago, my friend had reached out to me about
							a possible open position and wanted me to send him my resume. I first checked with him
							to see if my resume was up to par and he proceeded to comb through it and tear it apart.
							I decided to totally rewrite it, but figured that this would be a good opportunity to
							make a graphic resume like I had wanted to for some time. Over the course of a week it
							went through several iterations until I landed on what I consider to be a pretty good balance
							between design and function.

							<h2 class="diagram-title">Initial Design</h2>
							<p class="diagram-description">
								When considering a graphical design for this resume, I wanted it to have some sort of personality and for it to not follow
								the typical hierarchical listing of skills and experience. When I first mocked it up on a white board I had broken the
								sections into skills/tools at the top, current projects in the middle, and relevant experience and interests at the bottom. This
								was illustrated with icons of various technologies floating around the head of a person holding a board with projects, all above
								a more standard section listing experience.

						<p class="diagram-description">The transition from a hand-drawn mockup allowed me to get a better idea of positioning and color scheme.

							<h2 class="diagram-title">First Iteration</h2>
							<p class="diagram-description">After a day or two, I had completed my first iteration. Aside from an official color scheme and better spacing and sizing of elements,
								the major change I made was to how the project board was to be presented. Rather than simply provide a title and icon with a descriptive list below it, I broke down each
								project into "The What" (which described the project) and "The How" (which described the tools used for the project). I thought that this was a good way to list skills while
								also giving them context.

							<p class="diagram-description">The experience section was laid out pretty traditionally with it leading right into an awards/achievements and interests section. While I was

								unnecessary margins.

							<h2 class="diagram-title">Outside Perspective</h2>
							<p class="diagram-description">Before settling on this version, I passed it on to some of my friends including one who has some graphic design experience. He addressed
								some of the issues I had felt self-conscious about and created a more blocked out version of the resume which proved to be much more ergonomic and easier to read.

							<h2 class="diagram-title">Second Iteration</h2>
							<p class="diagram-description">
								The second iteration introduced another big change to the projects board with a new, 3 column break down.
								I realized that a brief description and list of tools didn't tell the reader enough about the process. I introduced
								a "Learned" column along with renaming the others from "The What" to "Developed" and "The How" to "Used". This felt
								like a necessary improvement along with a more logical breakdown of a project.

						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p class="diagram-description">Going off of the changes my friend had made, I chose a darker color scheme and highlighted
							the footer to distinguish the experience and awards/achievements sections. I also found that I still had room to incorporate
							the interests section and did so within a large red circle at the bottom center of the page. While I had not considered this
							design to be the final version, I felt comfortable enough to start applying to jobs.

								What I value most about these unplanned projects however is the learning process and how the skills used gained from it will carry on to other future projects.
