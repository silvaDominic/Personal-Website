                        Mimsi reached out to me to design and create a new pitch deck for their
                        non-profit organization. Their vision was to abandon the traditional slide format in favor of a
                        more seamless experience that favored continuous scrolling and custom animations. The result is
                        a more immersive and illustrative experience on their accomplishments and plans for the future.

                            Unlike the traditional slide formats that one might produce in PowerPoint or Keynote, the
                            design was intended to be continuous and compelling. More modern presentation software like
                            Prezi, SlideBean, and the likes offered fun, interactive alternatives to the traditional
                            style, but they were quite limited when it came to customizing the core transition mechanics
                            and might require hacky solutions to achieve an intended design.

                        was a rather feature rich template and came close to what the client was looking for.
                        Unfortunately, much would still need to be modified and custom animations and transition effects
                        posed a real problem.</p>

                            Eventually I determined that this unique format, paired with custom illustrations and
                            transition effects, was not
                            achievable with typical presentation software. As a web developer, I donâ€™t think it was
                            surprising when I decided to develop it as a web document using purely HTML, CSS, and
                            Javascript. This allowed for much more freedom not only in terms of design, but
                            development as well. Specifications that might be difficult or even impossible to implement
                            in traditional software could now be solved using Javascript or CSS. A web document also
                            offered the ability to integrate into a website and operate on all devices responsively.

                            In order to keep the web document small and robust I wanted to avoid any code libraries. In
                            my pursuit of this I stumbled upon a relatively new feature to Javascript called the
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"
                               target="_blank">Intersection
                                Observer</a>. This feature provided a native way to track elements on the screen
                            and apply logic when they cross certain thresholds. It also achieved this without a taxing
                            event handler that is fired on every frame. The result is what you'd expect, but in a much
                            more efficient way.

                            What was important to consider when I was designing the new format was how the key sections
                            would be distinguished. Pitch decks can typically be broken down into several sections
                            (vision statement, solution, business model, financial plan, call to action, etc.). These
                            broader sections might be further expanded on with subsections.

                            While the diagram very clearly illustrates the separation of subject matter, the actual
                            implementation was not to contain anything so definitive. Header titles on the text boxes
                            helped distinguish the subsections, but the broader sections needed to be distinguished in a
                            more subtle manner. I decided to illustrate this by temporarily breaking from the scrolling
                            text box format and instead replace it with large, bold text. The title was further
                            emphasized by a solid, colored background and progression through these broader subjects was
                            done using gradients.

                            In presentations, illustrations are often used to supplement or create an association to an
                            idea that has been introduced from text. The same applies to the Mimsi pitch deck only we
                            wanted to depict the ideas introduced using animated vector art. This style complimented the
                            format, remained simple enough to not steal too much attention, and helped illustrate
                            certain ideas better.

                                By the end of the project I was very happy with the decision to create the pitch deck as a
                                web document. It was portable, easy to integrate, responsive, and most importantly the
                                client got exactly what they wanted.

                                Mimsi is doing incredible work in Haiti and soon across the world with their program.
                                The mission is led by Dr. Winfred Tovar., a medical doctor whose family hails from Haiti.
                                The goal is to ensure the safe passage for woman from pregnancy through childbirth and into motherhood.
                                By utilizing mobile technology and high impact training, Mimsi is able to change entire
                                communities for the better and in only the course of a few weeks.
                            </p>

                                Update: It pains me to say it, but unfortunately due to the pandemic Mimsi's operation came to a
                                halt in April of 2020 and the organization has remained inactive since.
