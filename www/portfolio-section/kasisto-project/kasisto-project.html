                        Working as a UI developer isn't just about taking designs and materializing them. As one
                        advances in their career, it's often expected to be familiar with different UI design patterns
                        and to be able to contribute to the evolution of designs along with the product and design
                        teams. I covered a lot of ground at <a target="_blank" href="https://kasisto.com/">Kasisto</a>
                        during my time there. Most of it was spent rearchitecting the project and creating a custom
                        component library, but there was one instance where my design experience directly lead to the
                        resolution of some very troubling UX.

                            Without getting too much into the business logic, this feature was highly trafficked and
                            vital when it came to configuring how and when a conversational model would deliver a
                            response to particular user queries. These responses where configured using a list of

                            The contents of each accordion however, featured a conditional form that could be used to
                            add one or more responses for that particular query. With many different response types, the
                            accordion could quickly fill up with <em>multiple viewports</em> worth of content. Not to
                            mention
                            there was no limit on the number of query types. So not only could the accordion list grow
                            quite long, but the contents of each could also get even longer.

                            In addition to all of the rearchitecting going on with the web portal, a design team had
                            audited the application and was working to deploy a new design system with vital features
                            getting the first treatment. While there were some UX improvements, it was all mostly a
                            fresh coat of paint. The product and design team couldn't ignore the problem with this
                            response page however and was working to make the experience more intuitive. Unfortunately,
                            both product and design teams became too fixated on the existing accordion pattern and
                            instead of considering different UI components altogether were simply exploring ways to
                            reinvent and improve the accordion pattern.

                            elements in a UI you'll know that it has its limitation when moving beyond the fold. Given
                            how many viewports worth of content there could be for any particular query type, direct
                            manipulation of these accordions (or the responses within them) could involve dragging
                            content vertically for an unreasonable amount of time. The design teams solution to this was
                            to eliminate this feature and have it be controlled by anchor points that showed the
                            position of the response and a drop down of positions to reorder to...

                            content within them (responses). So this anchor-dropdown feature was present on

                            levels! On top of this, vertical lines were added to connect the anchor points to help a
                            user differentiate between elements and levels. The feature began to smell of

                                After a couple of weeks of trying to make the new design work, I expressed to the team that I
                                wasn't feeling confident in the design and was going to explore an alternative.

                                where I face a lot of design challenges as well. The bulk of the development work I did
                                there was for a vendor side web portal that featured a car wash menu creation page. I went
                                through several iterations of designing this page and faced similar UX issues. In this
                                instance, we were trying render a series of menus alongside a form used to create/edit them.

                                Regardless of my efforts, I just couldn't find a design that wasn't a compromise to either
                                the form or menus. Similar to my team at Kasisto, I was transfixed on accommodating
                                <em>this</em> design. I took a break for a day or two and when I came back to it, had an
                                epiphany -- I don't need to render all of these menus at once. In fact, there really wasn't
                                even a point in rendering a polished looking menu <em>at all</em>.

                                After another day of considering an alternative, I landed on a far more intuitive design
                                that was more scaleable -- abstracting the subject and content to a side panel and rendering
                                the form to the right of it. This opened up so much screen real estate to the user and made
                                working through the form far more comfortable.

                                    key without sacrificing any screen real-estate. It could even be scaled

                            After considering what I had learned from my previous work at Hubcap, I took some time to
                            see how I could adapt the design to the Kasisto work. The thought was to take the query
                            types and abstract them to a side panel. From there selecting any particular query type
                            would load the related content beside it. Recall that reordering these query types and their
                            respective responses was also a requirement. Not only could responses be represented in a
                            nested tree list within the side panel, but the reordering could take place there as well.
                            The result was a far cleaner UI that was much easier to reason about.

                            rendered to the left as an abstraction of the actual content. This layout added the ability
                            to quickly focus on responses too.</p>

                                In order to sell this I had to present this to the team with more than just words. I
                                happened to be working in Confluence at the time and to my surprise, the UI was basically
                                what I was aiming for -- nested document titles in the left side panel and the content of
                                the page that was selected in the main body besides it. The documents were even reorderable!
                                I decided to mock up a dataset we had <em>in</em>&nbsp;Confluence along with some cropped screenshots
                                from the UI designs. I pitched it to the team very similarly as I did here -- recalled
                                Hubcap experience and resolution and then solidified it with a crude reproduction using a
                                tool <em>that also</em> utilized this UX pattern. By the end of the next day, the design team had
                                produced some new designs and all of the awkwardness had been thwarted.

                                Come implementation time I had a much better idea of how to go about it and it proved to be
                                far simpler. Aside from getting positive recognition from the greater team and company,
                                initial customer feedback was very positive and was typically emphasized as the favorite
                                part of the web portal redesign.

                            This anecdote feels like such a classic example of 'thinking outside the box' or 'taking a
                            step back'. My favorite part of it is that the outcome was overwhelming positive --
                            designers felt more confident and could put there efforts elsewhere, I had a <em>much</em>
                            better
                            time implementing the feature, and users got a vastly improved UX that wasn't unfamiliar.
