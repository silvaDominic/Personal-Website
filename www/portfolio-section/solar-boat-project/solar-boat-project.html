									The mechanical systems of the boat consisted of the drive train, propeller selection, coupling of motors, steering system, and boat assembly.
									Based on the success of the previous year’s performance, the Arneson drive train design was once again used, only with a shorter driveshaft.
									This design change was chosen to reduce weight, drag, and improve handling.

								<p class="diagram-description">The drivetrain design was based on the idea very similar to the Arneson surface driven system that is used on many race boats.
									This design appealed to the team since it was relatively simple and could reduce rotational inertia as well as handle
									large amounts of torque produced by motors. A dual gear ratio was implemented to accommodate the drastic change in performance between the endurance and sprint races.

								<p class="diagram-description">The team opted for a similar design as the previous year with a hydraulic fluid reservoir, transmitting motion
									through a piston cylinder. The major advantage of using this design is that it does not require electrical power and is a
									relatively simple system to build and maintain.

									D1200 AGM deep cycle batteries were used for the competition. Each battery weighed roughly 35 pounds and had a capacity of
									44 Ampere hours, with a maximum current of 2600 Amperes. The sprint configuration consisted of three such batteries in series, making a system
									voltage of 36V and the endurance configuration made use of two such batteries, making the system voltage to 24V. The self-consumption current and

								Factors that contributed towards the designing of the hull were the weight of the boat, the maximum speed necessary to achieve planing, and stability. Computer Aided Design (CAD)
								software was utilized to build computer models of different hulls. The same software was utilized to run flow simulations to analyze
								water streamlines around the hulls and determine drag and lift. After running tests on several models, we chose the best two models based on the least drag and largest lift.

								Then the entire plug was encapsulated in a vacuum bag and all air was removed making the vacuum bag squeeze the carbon fiber layers together. After the curing of the epoxy, several layers
