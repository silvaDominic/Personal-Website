								The Carbon Monoxide Suppression Device was developed as part of a 4 person, senior design group at Stony Brook University and had
								the intention to address the problem of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure in residential environments during a leak. Since CO
								is an extremely toxic gas that is colorless, odorless and tasteless, emissions of the gas are dangerous to anyone who inhales it.
								Exposure to CO over a prolonged period of time can be potentially deadly at levels over 100 PPM. Currently, there are only devices available to detect
								CO in residential dwellings, but nothing that eliminates or suppresses it. This system was aimed to prevent illnesses and/or deaths caused by CO exposure.
								The design was composed of three major components: an airflow generator, filters containing a gold based oxidation catalyst, and the overall
								encasement of the system.

								<h2 class="diagram-title">Inception</h2>
								<p class="diagram-description">The concept for a Carbon Monoxide Suppression Device was originally inspired
									by one of the members of the group who was an active volunteer firefighter at the time. Recalling the lengthy and inefficient process
									of dealing with CO leak calls, he suggested creating a way to improve the system. Over time, as our group
									conducted more and more research, speaking with specialists and reading scholarly articles in regards to the
									process of removing CO, we fleshed out an idea. We eventually zeroed in on 2 existing technologies: a catalytic converter
									(found in almost any gas operated vehicle) and what's called a 'dry scrubber' (commonly used in industrial facilities to filter toxic gas).
									Both of these devices function by converting 'contaminated' gases into more benign ones through a catalytic reaction with another element.
								</p>

								<p class="diagram-description">
									A design was finally chosen when factoring in the most major parameter of the device: sufficient functioning
									in an ambient atmosphere (room temperature, regular humidity). A catalytic converter worked, but the materials used to
									produce a chemical reaction that would eliminate CO would require temperatures well over ambient atmosphere to be effective.
									A dry scrubber would also work in theory but requires high pressures and large components, making it more practical in commercial settings.
									Eventually, we landed on a new technology, known as NanAuCat, that utilizes nano gold particles to harness a catalytic reaction that eliminates CO
									in an ambient atmosphere.

								we are able to produce up to 500-600 CFM of airflow. Using our initial constraints, we would ideally be able to reduce similar CO levels to a safe level

								room, 2 functionality tests at 200PPM to ensure consistency, and 1 test at 700+ PPM to see how the device operates under extreme conditions. This all took place

								<p class="diagram-description">After testing and reviewing the results, we first had to consider any environmental factors or malfunctions that may have impacted results while testing.
									Throughout the course of the experiment, we experienced some inconsistency with the supplied CO detector used to measure the levels in the shed. This may have been
									due to a phenomenon known as sensor saturation, where the sensor retains CO between uses and gives an inflated reading. While this did have an effect on how thorough we wanted
									our tests to be, we still were able to have a few trials with normal functionality. The other factor that may have impacted our results was the shed having 2 vents.
									It's unlikely this skewed the results given how small they were, but this wouldn't be known until tested against a sealed space of the same size.

								<p class="diagram-description">The overall result of our test concluded that our device did work and meet our design goals, but
									did not do so comfortably due to the issues mentioned previously. It was found that the device oxidized CO at a rate of approximately 4.7PPM per minute, which
									ultimately met our design goal of reducing CO levels of 100PPM to less than 50PPM within 20 minutes. Based on this successful test, CO levels were reduced from
									106PPM to 50PPM in less than 12 minutes.
								</p>

								<p class="diagram-description">
									If future testing were to be conducted, we would want to be more prepared and have a more controlled environment.
									Having multiple CO detectors and testing in several, sealed spaces of varying sizes would ensure our results would be more consistent.
									The next step would be field testing the device in real world situations. This testing would occur during a CO call that the fire department
									would be called to.

									This project was another great example of understanding the development process from start to finish. While the lack of specific roles may make some cringe,
									it helped us maintain the same level of understanding and where one might fit in better than another given their innate skill set.
									Having a fair amount of freedom with this project also gave us the opportunity to approach the problem the way we desired and coordinate ourselves accordingly.
