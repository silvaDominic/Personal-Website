                    So right before I graduated college in 2014 I told myself that by 2016 I'd be calling Australia my home,
                    working for some renewable energy company on the weekdays, enjoying the Gold Coast on the weekends,
                    and melting to the distinct sound of those Aussie accents......HA!
                    Considering that I'm typing this from the bedroom I grew up in, I think that I may have really
                    screwed up somewhere. Well actually, that's what <span id = "you">you</span> would be thinking.
                    Rather than compare my current situation to that ambitious *cough* silly *cough* 'promise' I made
                    to myself a couple of years ago, instead I think of it as if nature took my hand,
                    gave me a smack, and whispered into my soul in a not so sweet Australian voice
                    "Oye, I don't think Australia is ready for you mate." Maybe I had been hyping things up a bit.
                    "...You might want to reconsider your career too." Oh come on!
                </p>
                <p class = "paragraph" id = "aboutme-description-2">
                    I think that change of direction stemmed from a gut feeling I got when I considered my future as a
                    body and soul rather than just another member of society. Life in Australia as an engineer certainly
                    sounds appealing (I'll travel there at some point, I'm sure), but I think I had a deep desire to
                    express myself through other means and I didn't see how taking that path would allow for such a thing.
                    It was around this time that I also started to seriously consider a dream of mine that I deemed
                    totally unrealistic right before I went off to college: becoming a game a developer.

                    After a summer of couch hopping, working at a restaurant, conversations with friends and family,
                    and self reflecting I decided that I wanted to learn software development and design in order to
                    [ultimately] become just that. What made game development an easy choice didn't so much have
                    to do with me growing up with video games, but that creating them incorporated a lot of other
                    disciplines that I'm interested in: design, digital art, photography, music, and storytelling.
                    These were the things that I felt would truly allow me to express myself. And while there is a video game
                    stigma among the older generations (I'm talking to the parents out there), it should be known that
                    it's also because of these things that video games have the ability to be wholesome projects that
                    require more than just quick reflexes and a sharp memory.
                </p>
                <p class = "paragraph" id = "aboutme-description-3">
                    It's been nearly a year and a half since I've made that decision and I've gotta say,
                    I feel much more confident about the switch now than I did then. My conceptual 'physique' is still slim
                    however, and it's at this point that I think moving into, what do they call it? the “real world”,
                    is necessary to solidify the core computer science and programming principles I've learned and
                    to start becoming familiar with the more nuanced ones. With this website finally up and running,
                    I think I'm one step closer to achieving that.

                <p id = "photography-description-body"> My interest in photography and photo editing developed after
                    the release of Halo 3 in 2007. The game featured a 'Theater Mode' that allowed players to rewatch
                    their gameplay experiences and snap pictures if they liked. After about a year I had reached the
                    photo limit for my account. From there I moved to my mom's digital camera, then to my friend's DSLR
                    in college, and eventually to my own DSLR recently.

                    I've taken thousands of pictures since my initial interest back in 2007 and have selected a
                    few of my favorite albums to share here. You'll find my recently accumulated work ranging from intimate nature shots
                    to candid views of a bustling port town.</p>
