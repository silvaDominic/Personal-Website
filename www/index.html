								So after I graduated college in 2014 I had second thoughts about the mechanical engineering and material science industries
								and decided to make a move to software development. With the guidance of a couple of friends in the industry and some 
								free online courses, I was able to develop an entirely new skill set, build numerous projects, and land a job all within 2 years time.
								While I've been learning how to program primarily within the context of web development, I am now heading full steam into
								game development.
							</p>
							<p class = "description-body" id = "aboutme-description-2">
								What made this an easy choice didn't so much have
								to do with me growing up with video games, but that creating them incorporated a lot of other
								disciplines that I'm interested in: design, digital art, photography, music, storytelling, etc.
								These were the things that I felt would truly allow me to express myself. And while there is a video game
								stigma among the older generations (I'm talking to the parents out there), it should be known that
								the all encompassing nature of video games allows them to be wholesome projects that
								require much more than just quick reflexes and a sharp memory.
							</p>
							<p class = "description-body" id = "aboutme-description-3">
								In addition to learning more about game development, I enjoy putting my web design and photography skills to use on
								freelance projects. You can find some of my work in the <a href="http://www.domsilva.com/?section=portfolioNode">Portfolio</a>
								and <a href="http://www.domsilva.com/?section=photographyNode">Photography</a> sections of the website.

							<p id = "photography-description-body" class="description-body"> My interest in photography and photo editing developed after
								the release of Halo 3 in 2007. The game featured a 'Theater Mode' that allowed players to rewatch
								their gameplay experiences and snap pictures of pretty much whatever they liked. As my library
								expanded, I eventually began to explore photo and video editing, capturing landscapes and moments
								from the game world that Halo 3 offered. From there, I used whatever camera I could get my hands on, moving from my mom's digital camera,
								to my friend's DSLR in college, to eventually my own.

								I've taken thousands of pictures since my initial interest back in 2007 and have selected a
								few of albums to share here. You'll find my recently accumulated work ranging from intimate
								nature shots, to candid views of a bustling New York City, to some more professional work.
