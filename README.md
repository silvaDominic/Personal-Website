# Photography-Website
http://www.domsilva.com

A personal photography website to showcase my photography and projects portfolios.

Development and optimization for this website is ongoing as of 05/20/2016.

Currently the site does not work properly in IE/Edge (go figure) and to a lesser degree in Safari. Despite the loss in some functionality, all information is retained.

UPDATES:

- Added to toolbox section
- Fixed some alignment problems in toolbox and about-me section
- Added background colors to buttons when hovered over and clicked on
	- This should make it a clear which section a user is currently on and that one does not need 		  to retract buttons to select another section.

TODOS:

Small Changes
- Implement lazy loading in photography section
	- Currently all images are loaded at once (only a problem for Nature album at the moment).

Medium Changes
- Add a couple of new albums to photography section
- Potentially move links at bottom of about-me section to top near button

Big changes
- Merge toolbox and games section. 
	- Create a projects section that includes subsections for various projects (games being one of 
	  them). 
	- Respective tools used during project development will be displayed alongside.
	- Replace missing section with something else.


Feel free to fork and/or reach out and offer feedback.
