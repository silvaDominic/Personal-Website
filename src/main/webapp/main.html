            While short and sweet, they demonstrate some core programming & game mechanic principles and were fun to make.<br>
            I plan to take a leap with my next game and create an original RPG.

            I am currently looking to expand my creative talent to the digital world. My vision includes innovating the educational system by implementing technology and game mechanics into curricula and <br>
            creating independent games that spark creative thinking and give direction.

        <p class = "paragraph" id = "right-description">
            I am currently learning how to program in Python, Java, and C# and have begun the conceptual framework for several small independent games.<br>
            I also have been learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript in order to build a website to host my photography portfolio.
