            <p class = "paragraph" id = "left-description">I am a recent engineering graduate from Stony Brook University.
                While I have developed many skills and enjoyed the many successful mechanical design projects that I have taken part in throughout my college career,
                I am currently looking to expand my creative talent to the digital world.
                My vision includes innovating the educational system by implementing technology and game mechanics into curricula and
                creating independent games that spark creative thinking and give direction.
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph" id = "right-description">
                I am currently learning how to program in Python, Java, and C# and have begun the conceptual framework for several small independent games.
                I also have been learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript in order to build a website to host my photography portfolio.

            <p class = "paragraph">In here you'll find some arcade games that I made while learning how to program <br>
                While short and sweet, they demonstrate some core programming & game mechanic principles and were fun to make.<br>
                I plan to take a leap with my next game and create an original RPG.

                Believe it or not, some of my first photographs were taken in Halo 3's Theater mode.<br>
                In here you'll find albums of my recently accumulated work ranging from hardcore nature shots to candid views of a bustling port town.
