    <p id = bio>I am a recent engineering graduate from Stony Brook University. While I have developed many skills and
        enjoyed the many successful mechanical design projects that I have taken part in throughout my college career,
        I am currently looking to expand my creative talent to the digital world. My vision includes innovating the
        educational system by implementing technology and game mechanics into curricula and creating independent games
        that spark creative thinking and give direction.

        I am currently learning how to program in Python, Java, and C# and have begun the conceptual framework for
        several small independent games. I also have been learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript in order to build a website to
        host my photography portfolio.</p>
