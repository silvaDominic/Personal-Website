                        <p class="diagram-description">Inspiration for this game was solely based on the mechanics; I've
                            had a desire for some time to create a game similar to
                            Super Smash Bros. that would include an array of custom characters designed and illustrated
                            by myself. However, with this being my first project
                            I didn't want to get too involved with asset creation and the extensive amount balancing
                            that would be required for more than a handful of characters. It would simply
                            be too ambitious of a first project. Instead, my plan was to create a 'lite' version of the
                            game, featuring only 3 characters, each with distinct play-styles. This would also
                            provide me with a solid framework for the more comprehensive version of the game I'd like to
                            eventually make.

                        <p class="diagram-description"> The answer to my behavior problem was the state machine. The
                            idea is simple: behaviours are consolidated into state objects that can be processed by a
                            single
                            entity (the state machine). If a player wants to jump, the input is evaluated and the state
                            is changed. This allowed for a very encapsulated and scalable model for handling behavior.
                            While
                            the concept sounds simple, it took quite a bit of time before I had this translated into
                            code and even longer for me to critique it and develop a flow for implementing each new
                            behavior.

                        <p class="diagram-description"> When I wasn't developing I was doing research. At times, this
                            literally meant playing Super Smash Bros. Although, 'playing' is not necessarily what I was
                            doing.
                            I would spend time going through each character and understanding how combos are registered
                            and input is handled. During this time, I actually began to pick up on subtleties I hadn't
                            noticed before. For instance, a slow acceleration of the character would gradually move them
                            to a 'full speed' running state. A quick horizontal snap of the analog stick however, would
                            instantly
                            bring the character to a faster-than-full-speed running state.

                            was how essential input management was.
                            This was particularly difficult when I was trying to evaluate multiple inputs at once. While
                            checking for multiple at the same time is possible,
                            a player must enter all inputs at the same exact time. It also didn't allow for checking the
                            same input twice or chaining.

                            coroutines. This was, as it sounds, slow, buggy, and only allowed for checking two inputs.

                        A combo would be represented as a series of strings that would be evaluated one by one: first
                        button pressed? Move up the chain. Second button matches combo? Move up the chain. Third button
                        not pressed in time. Combo unsuccessful, return false. This model was simple, allowed any sized
                        combos, and reused the same logic for each evaluation.

                        <p class="conclusion-body"> The first phase of developing this game has been a lot of research
                            and trying new things. With a functioning state machine and proper combo class
                            together, development has sped up very quickly and I can now focus on fleshing out each
                            character's movement & fighting profile. At the moment, the look of the game has not really
                            evolved passed the block on a platform state as functionality has obviously been the main
                            focus. Animating characters is right around the corner however, and I plan on doing a
                            preliminary photoshoot for one of the characters to see how animating real images will look.
