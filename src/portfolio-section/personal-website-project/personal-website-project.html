                        When I had come up with the concept for this project years ago, it was intended to solely be a
                        photography website. The design was incredibly minimal and was to be less about me and why I
                        enjoy photography and more about the images themselves. Once development for the website began
                        in February of 2016, I realized that the website would be better suited as a general portfolio
                        website rather than something so specific. Sticking with the theme of the initial design, my
                        goal was to avoid the common daily blogger design and instead implement an experimental,
                        minimalist design that evoked a sense of exploration.

                            Because I didn’t want this to be a traditional website, I didn’t consider any traditional
                            elements. If anything, I wanted the user to scratch their head and get a little curious.

                            I eventually decided that the albums should feel as though they are places and can be
                            ‘entered’ like doorways. This is exactly what I ended doing. The doors would appear in a
                            blank white space and feel as if they were alive; Birds come and go from a nature album,
                            servers occasionally pop in and out of a kitchen album, water breaks at the shore of a beach
                            album, etc. It was ambitious for someone with no web development experience, but I wanted
                            the user to feel as though they were actually entering a space and not just clicking a link.

                            Upon entering the album, a user would be presented with a full screen gallery with no menus
                            or visible buttons. Moving the mouse however, would reveal a slider and back button
                            disguised as a smaller doorway. What I liked about this design is that I could keep building
                            onto it. Perhaps as I accumulated more pictures related to a particular album, the doors
                            would begin to become a part of a greater scene that could be further interacted with.
                            Unfortunately, I didn't have the know how to do all of this and a lot of the flare was
                            stripped from the design.

                            After realizing how ambitious I was with the first design, I decided to take a step back.
                            The idea was to keep the minimal design but extend the site's purpose. This was done with
                            large button icons that would lead to other sub-pages of the site including a "games" and
                            "photography" section.

                            The "games" section featured a spinning wheel that, when clicked, would randomly select a
                            game and display it in a pop-out window. The "photography" section adopted the initial site
                            design and featured a series of themed doorways that led to different photo albums. The
                            middle section would essentially be a more verbose resume, featuring an about-me paragraph,
                            skill-list, a few sentences on interests, and contact info.

                            Eventually, I found that the resume design wasn't really looking or feeling like a modern

                            on a top-to-bottom node design. It retained the minimal aspect I wanted and would remain
                            sleek without requiring too much styling or script.

                            The nodes were to be different colors and labeled. When clicked, two larger circles would
                            fade in to the left and right of the selected node. This would include a brief introduction
                            to the section along with a link to a more in depth sub-page or contact info. After I had
                            the basic layout made, I started to realize that the circular nature of the nodes limited
                            the amount of text and formatting possibilities and I later abandoned the concept.

                            I started the expanding node design with a 'window frame' design where buttons corresponding
                            to each section were located at the corners of the frame. Similar to the original node
                            design, the buttons would fade in the respective content when clicked, the default being the
                            About Me section.

                            I quickly realized that I was losing a lot of space with the window frame design and that I
                            should be treating the entire screen as the window frame. I also didn’t like the idea of
                            having a default section already open. It felt like a step was missing or that it wasn’t
                            obvious that the buttons were to be clicked. I decided to make the buttons have 2 states: an
                            initial retracted state and a final expanded state. This gives the site a nice minimal
                            design like the original Node design and allows the user to ‘enter’ the site. Once expanded,
                            the buttons can be clicked and the previous content will be faded out and corresponding
                            content faded in.

                            Originally supposed to be a simple, single paged photography portfolio, the site slowly
                            evolved into a more comprehensive portfolio of some of my work and skills. Covering
                            everything from frontend and backend developments, UX/UI design, and server configuration,
                            this proved to be a big first step into web development. After a couple of months and
                            countless hours, I had achieved the minimal design I set out for as well as a place to share
                            my story and work.
